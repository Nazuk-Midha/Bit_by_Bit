Word Master is an engaging word-guessing game that puts your vocabulary and deduction skills to the test. Inspired by the classic game of Hangman, Word Master adds a twist by highlighting the letters present in the secret word, making it a challenging yet enjoyable experience.

Here's how the game typically works:

   Game Setup: Upon starting the game, the computer randomly selects a word from a valid dictionary. The length of the word is 5 letters.

   Highlighted Letters: Unlike traditional Hangman, where you start with a blank slate, in Word Master, the computer provides some hints. It highlights any correct letters that are present in the secret word. For example, if the word is "APPLE" and the computer highlights 'A' and 'E', you know that those letters are part of the word.

   Player's Turn: The player is given a certain number of attempts (often represented by "lives" or "guesses") to guess the word. On each turn, the player selects a letter that they believe might be part of the word.

   Feedback: After the player makes a guess, the computer provides feedback. If the guessed letter is in the word, it highlights letters. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses one of their attempts, and the computer may indicate that the guessed letter is not in the word.

   Guessing the Word: The player continues guessing letters until they either successfully guess the entire word or run out of attempts. If they manage to guess the word within the given attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

   End of Game: Once the game ends, whether in victory or defeat, the player may have the option to start a new game and challenge themselves with a different word.

Word Master provides an entertaining way to enhance vocabulary skills and sharpen logical thinking. With its combination of word recognition and deduction, players can enjoy a rewarding gameplay experience while expanding their language abilities.
