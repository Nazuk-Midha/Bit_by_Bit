 Welcome to 'Pig', a dice game!
    
    In this game, a user and a computer opponent 
    roll a 6-sided die each round. If the value of
    the die is a 1, the player that rolled the 1 loses
    all of their points. Otherwise, the player gets the
    value of the die added to their points. The first
    player to reach 30 points wins!
