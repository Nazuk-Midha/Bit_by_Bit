 Welcome to 'Pig', a dice game!
    
    In this game, a user and a computer opponent 
    roll a 6-sided die each round. If the value of
    the die is a 1, the player that rolled the 1 loses
    all of their points. Otherwise, the player gets the
    value of the die added to their points. The first
    player to reach 30 points wins!

Features


This implementation of the Pig Dice Game includes the following features:

Two players take turns rolling a single die. Each player's turn total and total score are displayed. Players can choose to hold their turn total and add it to their total score. Rolling a 1 ends the player's turn and forfeits their turn total. The game automatically switches turns after each turn ends. The game ends and declares a winner when a player reaches a total score of 100 points.
